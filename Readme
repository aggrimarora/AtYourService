I participated in the StartUp Weekend hosted by the Entrepreneurship Development Association and my team secured the 3rd place. It was a three day event where we had to pitch our ideas, work in a team to draft a business plan and then finally present it on the third day.

I developed a website (UI and front end to serve as a minimalistic product) within a day. It was a great learning experience for me in the field of business, developing presentation skills and growing as a person. We worked tirelessly on the business plan for approximately 54 hours and were mentored by several professionals who had entrepreneurial experience.
